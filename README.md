# FAQ's
- **Why did wlk.bat takes time to activate windows?**

  Well its actually many attempts of keys were be executed
  to add it to your computer. `slmgr.vbs` is taking much more time
  to activate your windows. It could be 1-2 hours after finishing the
  activations.
  
- **Why does `slmgr.vbs` gives me an error?**

  Check first your current windows version if its compatible with our
  tool. If its compatible and its not working, you can go to [issue](https://github.com/xqwtxon/wlk/issues)
  and report it to our support assistance team.
  
- **Why the tool is too much using cpu?**

  Due the many attempts of keys were be executed to activate windows,
  you may expect this cpu high usages. But some user's does not have
  any problems with cpu specially on their performance.

  You need an internet to use this tool because of we collect online keys to activate
  your windows online. We do this get updates from new windows updates worldwide!
  
- **I am getting a bug, what should i do?**

  You should [report us](https://github.com/xqwtxon/wlk/issues) by creating an issue on github,
  or contact my [email](mailto:xqwtxon@hotmail.com) for further questions and issues, Please be patient and wait
  for the reply of the software tool owner. It takes time to repond due the developer is not always on
  service, and have an limited time to work with it.
